Correct "Error starting userland proxy" Error
---------------------------------------------
If you get the following error when trying to bring up docker-compose:
Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:443: bind: address already in use

Run the following to identify and kill the blokcing processes:
$ sudo lsof -i tcp:{{blocking port}}
$ sudo kill -9 {{process id}}


About volumes and bind mounts
-----------------------------

A named volume is created by the following:
       volumes:
         - my-volume:/var/lib/db

This will map '/var/lib/db' onto the container, so go to that path to see the requested data


A bind mount is created by the following:
        volumes:
          - ./data/ASTGTMV003:/data

This will map make the contents of the host directory './data/ASTGTMV003' available at the path '/data' in the docker container. This can be confirmed using the command:
        sudo docker exec -it {{container_id}} ls -a /data

Note:
- binding of mounts and volumes happens when the docker-compose is pulled up, so changes will be reflected without needing to delete containers/images
- tested bind mounts and shown that files update live - change to host is immediately reflected in the container


About Auto-renewing certificates
--------------------------------

Use the command:
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run

to test the renewl process.  this only works if the nginx server is not running, so the service needs ot be brought down when renewing certificates.

If you get the following error of running certbot:
"another-instance-of-certbot-is-already-running"

Then:
Find and kill the certbot processes:
$ sudo ps -waef | grep certb
$ sudo kill -9 {{certbot prcess ids}}

Then need to clean up the lock files - first line to view only, second to also delete:
$ sudo find / -type f -name ".certbot.lock"
$ sudo find / -type f -name ".certbot.lock" -exec rm {} \;

Another useful command is to check the logs for renewal attempts:
$ sudo grep "random delay" /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log

To Edit Renewal Schedule
------------------------
The scheduling is done by crontab, edit using:
$ crontab -e

Note - DO NOT use sudo, it sets upa  different scheduler.

crontab currently calls the following script: ~/scripts/certbot-renew.sh
and logs the result to ~/cron.log


Deployment
----------
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
cp env/environments angular/src
cp env/.env nodejs
sudo docker-compose down
sudo docker system prune -a
sudo docker-compose up --build --detach

VM STORAGE 
***********

If machine gets restarted for any reason, mounted drives will be lost and need remounting.

Mounting a persistent disk to VM
--------------------------------
follow instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#formatting
** important: the disk should be attached as read/write in the google console  - check this in case of **
** error "cant mount read only disk" **
to list available disks: sudo lsblk
to mount the disk: sudo mount -o discard,defaults /dev/sdb ./data

Elevation Data ASTGTM_v003 data

Downloading source data
-----------------------
download data from: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search
login: ki..
passwrd: E..1
Use chrome extension "simple mass downloader" to download zips to directory
(copy list of urls from download page and use "paste from urls" option in extension)
Use command: "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" e *.zip -oc:\unzip
... to unzip all into a directory, losing the directory structure
Delete all *_num.tif files
Upload to cloud storage bucket (just upload files or folder): https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser?project=trailscape&prefix=

Copying ASTGTM files from Google Cloud Storage to VM Storage
-----------------------------------------------------------
go to destination and type (from https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/cp):
sudo gsutil cp -r gs://trailscape-geotiffs-europe/_ASTGTM .
