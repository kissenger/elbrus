Description of key files and folders, names are in general important and any change will need additional changes to setup:

folders
- angular --> source for the front end
- build-scripts --> scripts for setting up a new vm instance
- certbot-info --> automatically placed by certbot
- data --> mounted google persistant drive, containing elevation data
- dhparam --> contains key file for https authentication
- nginx-conf --> nginx configuration files. Subfolders are 'certbot' (use this path for launching server to obtain certbot certificates) and 'prod' (use this path for production)
- nodejs --> source for the backend
- delete-me --> containing files generate during build that I dont think are neeeded but which I'm not confident of deleting

files
- docker-compose.yml --> for building docker containers, see notes below
